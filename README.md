JS number sort visualization.
<br>
<br>
(5/5/23) V.1 is just attempt at visualizing a numeric array and sorting it at the click of a button. A future version might include more CSS styles, and a breakdown of the step by step sort process. My method of sorting for this push was using .sort() along with a comparison function. I included a hidden script of a different (perhaps less effective) way of sorting. I might use this in the future if I think it'll help with the visualization aspect since it allows me to see more of what goes on behind the scenes.
